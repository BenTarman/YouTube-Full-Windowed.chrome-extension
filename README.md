# YouTube Full Windowed (Chrome Extension)
**This extension enables the ability to toggle a full windowed mode for any YouTube video (excluding embedded ones).**

Sometimes you find yourself wanting a middle ground between the default YouTube video sizes and fullscreen â€” This extension offers just that. It adds a button within the YouTube player itself (and in the browser toolbar) that allows you to toggle a full windowed mode for your videos.

Disclaimer! This extension was built around the new YouTube layout (https://www.youtube.com/new) and does not promise full functionality on the previous layout.
